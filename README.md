This repository contains material related to the application of R-Shiny to Health Economics and Decision Science. There are three main parts: a pre-print publication explaining the benefits and process of making models Shiny, a simple application which can be run by the user by cloning this repo or copying the two files in the app folder, and a tutorial which goes into more detail describing the code.

Publication: https://github.com/RobertASmith/healthecon_shiny/blob/master/Publication/report.pdf
App files: https://github.com/RobertASmith/healthecon_shiny/tree/master/App
Tutorial: https://github.com/RobertASmith/healthecon_shiny/tree/master/Tutorial

We hope that others will contribute to this repository.
