Abstract: 
Health economic models have typically been built in spreadsheet software, mostly Microsoft Excel. However high level programming languages are increasingly being used as model complexity increases and additional requirements such as probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) result in long model run-time in excel . There is a particular push towards using R in health economics (Incerti et al., 2019; Jalal et al., 2017) because it is commonly used by statisticians, flexible and transparent, reusable and adaptable. One of R’s strengths is its large number of packages (e.g. bcea, heemod, darthpack) which allow R programmers to leverage the work of others within their code. However as a script based approach R’s weakness is that it does not have a user interface. The CRAN package ‘shiny’, which allows programmers to create Web-browser interfaces which interact with underlying R models, resolves this limitation. This tutorial uses a 4 state markov model (Alarid-Escudero et al., 2020) as a case-study to demonstrate a simple method of creating a shiny application from an existing R  model.
