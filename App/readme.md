## Sick Sicker example app files 

This is an example application which aims to be as simple a functioning example as possible. The full tutorial based on this simple application is here: 
https://github.com/RobertASmith/healthecon_shiny/tree/master/Tutorial

This folder contains two files:
- app.R
- wrapper.R

### app.R
This file contains a script with the user interface and server functions. In the top right corner there is a button 'Run App'. If you click this the application should then pop up.

### wrapper.R
This file contains a script with the model wrapper function in it. The functions *gen_psa* and *f_MM_sicksicker* are created within this function for simplicity. In more complex examples with longer code chunks functions would generally be created externally and sourced.
