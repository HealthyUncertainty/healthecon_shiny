This repository contains material related to the application of R-Shiny to Health Economics and Decision Science. There are three main parts to the repository: 
- a pre-print [publication](https://github.com/RobertASmith/healthecon_shiny/blob/master/Publication/report.pdf) explaining the benefits and process of making models Shiny.
- a simple online [application](https://robertasmith.shinyapps.io/sick_sicker/) which can be replicated by the user by cloning this repo or copying the two files in the [app](https://github.com/RobertASmith/healthecon_shiny/tree/master/App) folder. 
- a [tutorial](https://github.com/RobertASmith/healthecon_shiny/tree/master/Tutorial) which goes into more detail than the publication describing the code.
